To compile code:
  Have standard gcc compiler. Type "make" in the terminal within this 
directory to make three executable files from code mentioned above. Doing 
"make" will create object files from each source code file and automatically
link them appropriately to create executables. See makefile for details.

To generate Doxygen files:
  run "make docs" to generate the html files in the directory specified by the
make file. Then those files are copied to cpbove's public directory. Change as
appropriate.
